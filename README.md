### *Project 2: Investigate a Dataset*

In this project, I will analyze the dataset: No-show appointments (original source  [here](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments)).

This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row:
 - ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment. 
 - ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital. 
 - ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.  
 - The encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.

**The repository includes:**
-   The  report communicating my findings
-   Python code where I wrote as part of my analysis
-   The  data set I used
